## Goal
Just learnin' Elixir going through [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) by Dave Thomas.

Trying to do the whole book w/ TDD via ExUnit to pick up ExUnit and functional testing skills while I go.

## Rerun tests on change w/ guard ~> v1
bundle exec guard

## Running IEx.pry w/ mix tests

iex -S mix test

## Layout

```lib/ch#/examples``` and ```test/ch#/examples``` contain in chapter examples and arbitrary exercises I come up with along the way.

```lib/ch#/exercises``` and ```test/ch#/exercises``` contain "Your Turn" exercises.
